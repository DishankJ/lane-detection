# Walkthrough
First, `testimg.jpg` was converted to grayscale. Which was then blurred using Gaussian Blur. Then, I applied Canny function on the image. This gave us points (in white) where great gradient changes were observed, the rest points were black. I found out the region of interest in the test image and the coordinates of the polygon containing it. The `region_of_interest` function provided us with the cropped image, where only the lane lines were visible(basically the canny image in only the region of interest). This was achieved by `cv2.bitwise_and` function. Since the pixels outside region of interest in mask are all zeros, doing bitwise and operation meant those pixels became black, the pixels which were white in the canny image remained as white during the operation because bits in both images were '1's. I used `cv2.HoughLinesP` function to get Hough lines. An average line was found out for each lane on right and left using simple mathematics. I drew these lines on the original image by defining the function `display_lines`. The lane identified image is represented by the variable `combo_image`, bitmap generation image by `bitmap` variable, and background isolated image by `isolated_image`.
